# A React Native Todo App

This is a basic, simple, bare bones todo app. This project is more to do with learning React Native and Redux than to have a "useful" app.

_This application is still under development._ Here is what still needs to be done.
1. Settings screen
	* Allow users to change the color theme and save that setting
	* Choose to show completed todo items
	* Choose to receive notifications on due dats
2. Notifications
	* Receive notifications when a todo due date is approaching
3. Calendar
	* Allow users to save todo items and have them show in the calendar
4. AsyncStorage
	* We are saving to AsyncStorage directly, we need to abstract these actions since AsyncStorage is global.
5. Android
	* test using Android simulator, we have only been focusing on iOS
